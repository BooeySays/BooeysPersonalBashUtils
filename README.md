I ~~just started~~ am learning how to write BASH scripts, and how I learn is by diving head first in to whatever I am learning, and get hands on with it.

So I made a bunch of scripts for myself. I made things like:

1. Scripts that saves me from having to type the same things over and over. 

     - For example, I usually run **ls** after I use **cd** to change directories because it helps show me where I am, figure out where I should **cd** into next, and / or, how the next DIR that I am going into is spelt. 

     - Or, a script that will automatically set up all of my aliases and built in commands, set with all of the options and arguments that I like them set. 

     - Or, a script that will allow me to search Google from inside my terminal with the hotkeys [CTRL] + [k], just like Google Chrome. 

2. I also spent a lot of time on coming up with ways to _pimp_ out my terminal by customizing things like the prompt so that would display a lot more information that I find useful. This, is actually how I learned a lot of 
     - and of course, I would have all the information displayed in an organized, color coordinated, uncluttered, way.


3. I often get asked Linux/Android related questions. How do I do this, that, etc, etc. I don't handle dealing with idiots too good. So instead of walking them through something, I will just write up a script that will do everything for them. And if I get bored, to help everyone learn and understand what is going on, I will even write it so that the script will explain everything before doing anything.
