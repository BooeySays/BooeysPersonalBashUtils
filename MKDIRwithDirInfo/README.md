# Dir_Info_Generator_And_Reader

## What:
This little script will overwrite the mkdir command 
and update it so that it will create a small hidden 
dir.nfo file in the directory. The file will just 
contain a small description of what the directory is 
when housing.

The cd command will also be updated to look for the 
dir.nfo file everytime it changes into a new DIR, and 
print (cat) it on the sreen if it exists.
